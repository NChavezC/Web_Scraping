74,If we don't save Rob there will be literally no conservatives left to debate guys lol
75,The big causes of sexual coercion imo are bad social expectations of men to be too aggressive and women to be too passive. It's a shitty system that we all play into that leads to horrible outcomes for all parties involved.

97,"It's especially insane that someone could add ""I feel like I'm going crazy..."" and then they proceed to just INVENT new facts to fit their narrative. Classic abuser behavior, ""I feel like I'M going crazy..."" then forces you to accept false narrative/facts."

120,"No, fuck you. I'm not going to play babysitter and feel like I need to correct people who think I'm running cover for rapists. I have enough credit by now that any rational thinking human, ESPECIALLY another content creator, should know better by now than to see a clip like that."
